\item{x}{\strong{data.frame} \cr Data.frame containing data for a specific concentration level.}

\item{weightingMethod}{\strong{character(1)} \cr Method for weighting (currently "1/x", "1/x^2" and "None" are supported, default is "1/x^2").}
}
\value{
Vector of a constant weights for each measurement in this concentration level.
